The Vehicle Control System project is a C programming project that simulates a vehicle's sensor readings and allows the user to control various aspects of the vehicle. The user is prompted to choose from three options: turn on the vehicle engine, turn off the vehicle engine, or quit the system. If the user chooses to turn off the engine, they will be prompted again to choose from the same three options. The system responds to different traffic light colours and simulates the vehicle's speed and temperature. Additionally, there is a bonus requirement to create a preprocessor directive that compiles and runs specific code related to the engine temperature controller.
